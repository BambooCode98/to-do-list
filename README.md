# to-do-list
This to-do list app has a project selection, a note selection, and a list selection. Each selection has slight differences, however, as they are all very similar in function. This was designed to be a simple to-do list with an earthy theme, and it seems the CSS applied to the project accomplishes this well. 


Things that can be added to this project to make it more feature rich include: 

  1. A calendar selection that shows the current date, and all created projects.

  2. A calendar popup when choosing a date in the project/note/list creation window.

  3. More details that can be added to the project/list creation window.

  4. More methods of interactivity with the user.

Given the scope of the project was to put classes, factory functions, modules, import/export, and webpack into use after learning about the topics, I think the finished product demonstrated these new topics very well in the code.

What I learned from doing this project: 

  1. How to use factory functions, and their design pattern.

  2. How to use classes even though I went with factory functions in this program.

  3. Gained further experience refactoring code, and improving it with functions. However, I still have more to practice until I get very good with keeping code clean and minimal.

  4. Gained a better overall understanding on how to use functions to make many things at once.

  5. Learned more about dynamically making website components through javascript.

  6. Learned how to thoroughly use import and export in modules.

  7. Gained a better understanding of webpack.

Areas to improve upon:

  1. Learn how to use npm packages better to incorporate them into my code.

  2. Learn more about factory functions/classes.

  3. Gain more experience with webpack, and its many features.

  4. Become more familiar with DRY principles to clean up the code and make it easier to maintain.

  5. Understand the javascript design patterns more thoroughly.

  6. Learn how to better use sessionStorage/localStorage to prevent the current problem in the program where it will only save the created obejcts upon object creation.

  7. Learn how to better handle modules.

Overall, based on current experience and knowledge to this point, this project turned out very well. When I learn more I would like to be able to add more features onto this project, however, a new project similar to this one, with a backend, would be used instead.
